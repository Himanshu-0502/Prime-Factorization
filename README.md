# Prime Factorization

## Overview

This repository contains C++ implementations for prime checking and factorization using advanced mathematical algorithms. The primary functionalities include checking if a number is prime and factorizing a given number into its prime factors.

## Files

- `Prime.cpp`: Contains the implementation for checking if a number is prime.
- `Factorization.cpp`: Contains the implementation for factorizing a given number into its prime factors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Himanshu-0502/Prime-Factorization.git
    cd Prime-Factorization
    ```

2. Compile the programs:
    ```sh
    g++ Prime.cpp -o prime
    g++ Factorization.cpp -o factorize
    ```

3. Run the programs:
    ```sh
    ./prime
    ./factorize
    ```

## Usage

- To check if a number is prime, run the `prime` program and enter the number when prompted.
- To factorize a number into its prime factors, run the `factorize` program and enter the number when prompted.
